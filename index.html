    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="IMG_2001.jpg" alt="Luke Mmanyi" class="profile-photo">
    <p>I’m Luke Mmanyi, a motivated high school student from Lakota East High School, passionate about software development. I’m curious, hardworking, and a natural problem solver. I love working out, reading philosophy, playing basketball, and watching sports. My motivation for pursuing software development comes from my desire to help others who may feel lost or stuck in life, just like I once did. My brother has been a huge inspiration to me, and I believe the endless possibilities in technology can solve real-world problems and help people.</p>

  <section id="journey">
    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>I've been coding for over a year now and have dived into various languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, and more. I’ve participated in TechOlympics, pitched an idea, and completed courses like Computer Science Principles and Cybersecurity 1 at Lakota East High School. This journey has only just begun, and I’m excited to continue learning, especially as I move on to AP Computer Science A and Cybersecurity 2 and 3 next year. My passion for building software grows every day, and I’m eager to make an impact.</p>
